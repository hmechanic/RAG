# Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques 

**RAG** is a powerful AI tool designed for **real-life applications**. It supports the integration of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including both **open-source** and subscription-based options. Additionally, it allows the implementation of advanced reasoning and foundation models to generate responses based on your **own data**.
To develop AI applications, we use **LlamaIndex** as the data orchestration framework. We also explore tools like **Groq**, which provides high-performance language processing units and free access to powerful open-source models.
